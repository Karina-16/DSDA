#HYPOTHYROID PREDICTION (Machine learning)  

‚óè 	Description: Hypothyroidism can be difficult to diagnose early due to its symptoms overlapping with many other conditions. 
Traditional diagnostic methods are often slow and expensive. 
In this project, we utilized machine learning techniques to analyze patient data, enabling faster and more accurate prediction of hypothyroidism. 
We preprocessed the data, engineered relevant features, and trained various machine learning models to identify patterns indicative of hypothyroidism. 
Our approach not only enhances diagnostic speed but also improves the overall accuracy of hypothyroidism detection.
