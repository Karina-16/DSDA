# hypothyroid detention (machine learning)
 
 Hypothyroidism can be hard to diagnose early because its symptoms are common in many other conditions. Traditional diagnosis methods are often slow and expensive. By using machine learning, we can quickly analyze patient data to predict hypothyroidism more accurately.
 
This project aims to improve early detection and treatment, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes and making healthcare more efficient.
